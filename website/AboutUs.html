								<h3><a href="#">Barangay 136 Zone 15 History</a></h3>
								<p>In our barangay on 1975, MAGNERICO "Naring" Ochoa was appointed OIC(Officer-in-Charge) of barangay 26 which happens to be the combination of barangay 136 and 138 at present and later in 1977, Capt. Ochoa gave his position to his first kagawad who happens to be Kag. Alma "Mimi" Ching as the new Barangay Chairwoman. </p>
								<p>After 1 1/2 years of service as chairwoman of brgy. 136, Capt. Ching passed the leadership to Mr. ConstancioSalonga as the new Brgy. Captain in 1979. In 1986 after the February Revolution, Mr. Ernesto de Guzman was then appointed by Mayor Calixtotobe the new Chairman of Brgy. 136.</p>
								<p>Then in 1990 when brgy election was held again, it was Mr. Rodrigo "Rody" Vasquez who top the election and became brgy captain. As years passed, a pattern was set-up in the manner of electing brgy.</p> 
								<p>officials for the 1994 election polls. One is for all Punong Barangay aspirants and one for kagawad which was being taken up to the present. In 1194 election, Chairman vasquez was defeated by Bonaparte Ochoa. After 2 years, Chairman Ochoa losses to Roberto Serrano in 1997 election. In year, 2000 the scheduled electiuon of barangay was postponed due to lack of fund. </p>
								<p>The election was held last 2002 when Chairman Serrano was defeated by Rodrigo Lualhati. After 2 1/2 years, Chairman Lualhati resigned and gave the position to his frost kagawad Gloria Capisnon who served as Chairwoman in 2004 up to 2007. </p>
								<p>When the COMELEC set the date on 2007, everybody was excited. Frustration on the Administration, people wants Changes. Five Aspirants for chairmanship and twenty-seven kagawad runs in our brgy 136. for the 2007 Barangay Poll Election.</p>
								<p>It was Long leg Lady Mary Dorothy "Ochie" De Guia won the election as the new barangay chairwoman of brgy. 136. As first timer on political affairs and as a Public Servant, Chairwoman De Guia already encountered problems that needs to be changed and as a saying "NO RETREAT, NO SURRENDER", Chairwoman De Guia is fit fo the job as she is willing to sacrfice her time, whole effort and even spent her own money for the changes she will make in our beloved Barangay.</p>
								<p>Chairwoman Otchie served her time from 2007-2018, during these years she was being helped by her daughter in the legacies she made.  And since the work is very demanding her daughter was asked to help out they managed the programs hand in hand.</p>
								<p>Now the demand for focus was so crucial, and she (Krissy de Guia) had the expertise in management she devised a system called “BLOCKS” to empower the kagawads to make decisions and also train them in handling barangay matters.</p>
								<p>Since Chairwoman Otchie’s term was already done and the people wante continuity of the quality service, Miss Krislyne Marty de Guia was urged to run for office and people spoke, she won and continued the service.
								</p>
								<p>At present, our barangay garnered significant awards and accomplishments like DRUG CLEARED BARANGAY (Jan 2019- present) and BARANGAY POGI 2019. Her young and advanced style of management opened doors and presented our barangay as a proactive barangay.
